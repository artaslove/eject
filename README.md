# eject

MSI's hotkey software seems to be incompatible with Windows 10. 
As well, on some MSI laptops, there is no eject button on the DVD. 
This AutoHotKey script adds the eject button function back. 

Tested on MSI MS-16D3

ToDo: deduce the scancodes for the additional "e" and "p2" keys above the keyboard
